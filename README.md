# AutoMark üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìã:
AutoMark is a smart Attendance system that uses the OpenCV and Haar-Cascade Classifier to mark the attendance of the students.
![Designer (1)](https://github.com/SINGHxTUSHAR/AutoMark/assets/113624520/b6778527-0c5e-4eff-b816-80ac06baaa04)

This project implements a smart attendance system for students using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) and a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:
### `System Components:`
* Camera: Captures real-time video feed of the students.
* OpenCV Libraries: Used for image processing tasks like frame grabbing, face detection, and drawing bounding boxes.
* Haar Cascade Classifier: A pre-trained model that efficiently detects frontal human faces within the video frames.
* Student Database: Stores student information like IDs, names, and potentially facial images (optional for enhanced recognition).
* Attendance Marking System: Logs attendance data, typically with timestamps and student IDs. This can be a simple text file, a spreadsheet, or integrated with existing attendance management software.

### `Working Process:`
* Real-time Video Capture: The system continuously captures video frames from the camera.
* Face Detection: OpenCV utilizes the Haar cascade classifier to identify and locate faces within each frame.
* Student Recognition (Optional): If the system stores student facial data, additional algorithms (not necessarily Haar cascade) might be used to recognize specific students within the detected faces.
* Attendance Marking: Based on detected faces (and potentially recognized students), the system marks attendance in the database. This might involve recording timestamps and student IDs (or names).
* Visualization (Optional): The system can display the video feed with bounding boxes around the detected faces for real-time monitoring purposes.

### `Benefits:`
* Automated Attendance: Eliminates the need for manual attendance checks, saving time and reducing errors.
* Scalability: The system can handle multiple students simultaneously.
* Reduced Contact (Optional): If facial recognition is implemented, students might not need to physically interact with a device to register attendance.
* Cost-effective: Leverages open-source libraries like OpenCV, making it a budget-friendly solution.

### `Limitations:`
* Haar cascade limitations: The pre-trained model might struggle with angled faces, poor lighting conditions, or occlusions (e.g., hats, masks).
* Privacy Concerns: Storing student facial data raises privacy considerations that need to be addressed with proper security measures and user consent.


## Commands ‚úçÔ∏è:
* This will be used to add face to dataset and face will be recorded via webcam.
```bash
python Add_faces.py
```
* Record attendance of added face , press 'o' to record attendance and it will create csv file corresponding to date present , name and timestamp will be recorded.
```bash
python test.py
```
* Attendance will be displayed here and can be downloaded in csv format.
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
